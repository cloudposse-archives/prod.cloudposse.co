  Terraform/Kubernetes Reference Infrastructure for Cloud Posse Production Organization in AWS.

  __NOTE:__ Before creating the Production infrastructure, you need to provision the Parent ("Root") Organization in AWS (because it creates resources needed for all other accounts).

  Follow the steps in [README](https://github.com/cloudposse/root.cloudposse.co/blob/master/README.md) first. You need to do it only once.

  ## Introduction

  We use [geodesic](https://github.com/cloudposse/geodesic) to define and build world-class cloud infrastructures backed by AWS and powered by Kubernetes.

  `geodesic` exposes many tools that can be used to define and provision AWS and Kubernetes resources.

  Here is the list of tools we use to provision `cloudposse.co` infrastructure:

  * [aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault)
  * [chamber](https://github.com/segmentio/chamber)
  * [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
  * [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops)
  * [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/)
  * [helm](https://helm.sh/)
  * [helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile)

includes:
  - "docs/terraform.md"
  - "docs/targets.md"
  - "docs/kops.md"
  - "docs/backing-services"
  - "docs/helmfile.md"

quickstart: |-

  ### Setup AWS Role

  __NOTE:__ You need to do it only once.

  Configure AWS profile in `~/.aws/config`. Make sure to change username (username@cloudposse.com) to your own.

  ```bash
  [profile cpco-prod-admin]
  region=us-west-2
  role_arn=arn:aws:iam::590638247571:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole
  mfa_serial=arn:aws:iam::681280261279:mfa/username@cloudposse.com
  source_profile=cpco
  ```

  ### Install and setup aws-vault

  __NOTE:__ You need to do it only once.

  We use [aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault)
  to store IAM credentials in your operating system's secure keystore and then generates temporary credentials from those to expose to your shell and applications.

  Install [aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault/releases) on your local computer first.

  On MacOS, you may use `homebrew cask`

  ```bash
  brew cask install aws-vault
  ```

  Then setup your secret credentials in `aws-vault`
  ```bash
  aws-vault add --backend file cpco
  ```

  For more info, see [aws-vault](https://docs.cloudposse.com/tools/aws-vault/)


  ### Build Docker Image
  
  ```
  # Initialize the project's build-harness
  make init

  # Build docker image
  make docker/build
  ```

  ### Install the wrapper shell
  ```bash
  make install
  ```

  ### Run the shell
  ```bash
  prod.cloudposse.co
  ```

  ### Login to AWS with your MFA device
  ```bash
  assume-role
  ```

  ### Populate `chamber` secrets

  __NOTE:__ You need to do it only once for a given set of secrets. Repeat this step if you want to add new secrets.

  Populate `chamber` secrets for `kops` project (make sure to change the keys and values to reflect your environment; add new secrets as needed)

  ```bash
  chamber write kops <key1> <value1>
  chamber write kops <key2> <value2>
  ...
  ```

  __NOTE:__ Run `chamber list -e kops` to list the secrets stored for `kops` project

  Populate `chamber` secrets for `backing-services` project (make sure to change the values to reflect your environment; add new secrets as needed)

  ```bash
  chamber write backing-services TF_VAR_POSTGRES_ADMIN_NAME admin
  chamber write backing-services TF_VAR_POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD supersecret
  chamber write backing-services TF_VAR_POSTGRES_DB_NAME app
  ```

  __NOTE:__ Run `chamber list -e backing-services` to list the secrets stored for `backing-services` project

  __NOTE:__ Before provisioning AWS resources with Terraform, you need to create `tfstate-backend` first (S3 bucket to store Terraform state and DynamoDB table for state locking).

  Follow the steps in this [README](conf/tfstate-backend/README.md). You need to do it only once.

  After `tfstate-backend` has been provisioned, follow the rest of the instructions in the order shown below.


  ### Provision `dns` with Terraform

  Change directory to `dns` folder
  ```bash
  cd /conf/dns
  ```

  Run Terraform
  ```bash
  init-terraform
  terraform plan
  terraform apply
  ```

  For more info, see [geodesic-with-terraform](https://docs.cloudposse.com/geodesic/module/with-terraform/)

  ### Provision `cloudtrail` with Terraform

  ```bash
  cd /conf/cloudtrail
  init-terraform
  terraform plan
  terraform apply
  ```

  ### Provision `acm` with Terraform

  ```bash
  cd /conf/acm
  init-terraform
  terraform plan
  terraform apply
  ```

  ### Provision `chamber` with Terraform

  ```bash
  cd /conf/chamber
  init-terraform
  terraform plan
  terraform apply
  ```
